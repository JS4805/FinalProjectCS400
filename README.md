This fridge organizer uses a Hash Table to input food items and specific data about those elements into the program. The elements it needs are the items: Name, Amount, Unit, Purchase Date, and Expiration Date. The program allows you to add, remove, change, or find items in the fridge. It also lets you print out or clear all of the items if you would like to do so. You also can save the items you have a reload them in the program the next time you use it. Feel free to quit the application at anytime with the command aswell. Run the program with the command make in the terminal.
